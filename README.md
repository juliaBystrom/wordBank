### Project description

The project's target group will be people who aim to learn a new language. The user will be able to translate a word or expression from one language to another, and in a quick and easy manner save that translation in a personal bank. To be able to use this feature the user will need to create an account and log in. The user can organize the translations in different boards and add information to support learning, in the form of a tag or comment.

### File structure

Files are structured into the folders: models, presenters, views. In views we have an additional
folder called components for parts in the application that is frequently used e.g. buttons, img
tags, text.
